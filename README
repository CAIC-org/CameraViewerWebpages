This set of files can be used to host a basic static webpage.

index.html, style.css, and error.html are boiler plate HTML files that are used for the main part of the site.

The index.js file reads the contents of s3 buckets and displays images on the webpages.


The other part of this project is the EC2 Linux instance that runs a scraper script every hour and uploads the files to S3.

See CameraPyScraper for information on the EC2 scraper.
